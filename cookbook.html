This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in the  menu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. It can also be added as a component to build other great tasting dessert creations.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

                <li>10 pieces eggs</li>
                <li>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)</li>
                <li>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> </p>
            
            <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).</li>
                <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater</li>
                <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly</li>

                <li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold</li>
                <li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold</li>

        <li>21 crackers graham cracker, plus more, crushed, for topping</li>   
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the mangoes and cut the lobes off as close to the pit as possible. Thinly slice half of the mango lobes into ¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ-inch (15 mm)-thick slices, keeping the slices intact and transferring to a tray or plate. Cover and refrigerate until ready to assemble. Cut the remaining mango into ¬Ω-inch (1.24 cm) cubes. Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to assemble</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of cream to a chilled large bowl and use an electric hand mixer to beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, 3‚Äì5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 cups of cream and beat again until stiff peaks form, 3‚Äì5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add half of the condensed milk and beat until fully incorporated. Add the remaining condensed milk, vanilla, and salt and beat until fully incorporated and stiff peaks form, 4‚Äì7 minutes. Give the mixture a final stir with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Line a chilled 7 x 11 (17 x 27 cm) -inch glass dish with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of the dish with a single layer of graham crackers, breaking to fill in any gaps as necessary. Spread 2‚Äì3 cups (480-720 ml) of the whipped cream mixture evenly over the graham crackers, all the way to the edges and corners of the dish. Top with ¬Ω of the diced mango. Repeat to make another layer. For the final layer, arrange the graham crackers over the diced mango and top with 2‚Äì3 cups of whipped cream. Arrange the thinly sliced mango decoratively on top. Sprinkle crushed graham crackers around the edge of the float.</li>
        <li>Cover the mango float in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4‚Äì6 hours, until the cream sets and the graham crackers soften and absorb some moisture. Transfer the float to the freezer for 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the float from the freezer and use the parchment paper to lift out of the dish. Let thaw for 5‚Äì10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite dessert wine, cocktail, coffee, or tea.</li>
